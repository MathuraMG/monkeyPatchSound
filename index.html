    <h2 class="page-heading"> Canvas O/P Tonal Testing </h2>

    <h3 class="page-title">Why are we doing this?</h3>
    <p class="page-content">
      Since the content of the canvas is inaccessible, it is important to
      ensure that the content can be explained in some way - especially in the
      case of movement/ To do this, we add a tonal output to indicate movement.

    <h3 class="page-title"> Examples </h3>
    <a class="page-link" href="examples/example3.html">Multiple object Example </a>
    <a class="page-link" href="examples/example2.html">Single object Example </a>

    <h3 class="page-title"> Methods Tested </h3>
    <h4 class="page-sub-title"> Method 1 - Frequency vs. Volume </h4>
    <p class="page-content">
      In this case, the movement from left to right is indicated by an increase
      frequency from 65Hz to 1760Hz.
      Movement from up to down in indicated by a derease in volume.

    </a>
    <h4 class="page-sub-title"> Method 2 - Panning vs. Frequency </h4>
    <p class="page-content">
      In this case, we take advantage of stereo outputs. Movement from left to right is
      indicated by panning the sound from the left to the right earphone/headphone.
      Also, since a lot of cultural references have higher frequency on top and lower in the bottom (such as bombs dropping in the road runner show!),
      up to down movement is indicated by a decrease in
      frequency from 1760Hz to 65Hz.

    </a>

    <h3 class="page-title">Implementation</h3>
    <p class="page-content">
      The implementation to get the data for the p5 objects is done using an
      interceptor/monkey patch. The patch gets the position of the object from the function
      call and compares it with previous position.
      If there is a change in position, then the necessary mapping is done to produce the sounds.
      As of now, this implementation exists only for one moving object.
