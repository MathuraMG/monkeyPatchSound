    <h3 class="page-title">Why are we doing this?</h3>
    <p class="page-content">
      Since the content of the canvas is inaccessible, it is important to
      ensure that the content can be explained in some way. To do this, we
      added a textual counterpart to every object drawn on the canvas.
    </p>
    <p class="page-content">
      The output contains a summary which is a gist of what is present in the
      canvas along with a table that contains details of objects. Both summary
      and table update in realtime with the sketch.
      NOTE: The output is currently visible - however this will not be the
      case in the IDE. This is just temporary for also testing without a
      screenreader.
    </p>

    <h3 class="page-title">Implementation</h3>
    <p class="page-content">
      The implementation to get the data for the p5 objects is done using an
      interceptor/monkey patch. The patch gets the arguments from the function
      call and store it in a variable.
      This content (summary and details) is refreshed every 100 frames - it
      contains the approximate location of the object along with its colour and
      other attributes.
